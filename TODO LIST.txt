APP:
1)	Test app on physical device to ensure scanning actually works (Displays full book info from Google Books).

7)	Send/receive messages about book.
		Message about which book was scanned, need two buttons to determine if it's been returned or borrowed for books with multiple copies?.

DATABASE:
2)	Build pages and host with Tomcat

3)	Does it only need to save barcode ID?
4)	What about books with multiple copies?
		Presumably can just allow it, unique identifier is ID not isbn/barcode so can have multiple copies per list and will check out/return first the query encounters.
5)	For start just two columns in table (Books in and out of stock)?

6)	Implement sending/receiving of messages about book returning and borrowing.
