Barcode scanning-based library system Android app for Optimation NZ Auckland office.

I am creating an Android app that will scan barcodes, allowing an office library system to track books. This will hopefully be integrated with the similar system being developed in the Wellington office. 

The app utilises the zxing barcode scanner and the Google Books API.
