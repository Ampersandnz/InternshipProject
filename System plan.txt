MOST BASIC FEATURES FIRST - Borrow, return book buttons work as required, screens display correct information
	THEN INTEGRATE WITH DATABASE - Host database somewhere
		THEN MORE ADVANCED FEATURES - Recently scanned/All currently borrowed by username in main screen
			THEN TESTS/ERROR CHECKING/INCORRECT USER ACTIVITY - Until then just me testing functionality so assume all user actions compliant with model of expected behaviour
				THEN USER-FRIENDLINESS/EASE OF USE/FANCINESS/AUTOMATION/UNNESSECARY BUT USEFUL FEATURES ie Automatically getting copy borrowed by saved username
					THEN LOOK/FEEL/AESTHETIC - Images, colours, swiping?

Scan button
At bottom/in options menu add option to delete/edit saved username
	Scanning app
		"Looking for book data, please wait" - Timeout after ~10 seconds? App is to enhance convenience
			See full book data (Barcode -> ISBN -> Google Books)
				Buttons at bottom - Borrow, Return, [Add to library], [Remove from library]
					Borrow
						Connect to database
							Prompt asking for username if not saved
								Prompt asking to save username if not saved
									Record checkout in database
						Disconnect from database
						"You have borrowed: Book title, ISBN"
					Return
						Connect to database
							Select copy automatically if only one/only one borrowed/one borrowed with username = saved username
							Else list all copies and current borrower
								User selects copy
									Record return in database
						Disconnect from database
						"You have returned: Book title, ISBN"
					Add to library
						Connect to database
						Add book entry to database (MAY BE MULTIPLE COPIES OF BOOK, ALLOW FOR THIS)
						Disconnect from database
						"Book title, ISBN has been successfully added to the database"
							Probably not necessary, user is prompted when a book is scanned that is not in the db (WILL ONLY WORK FOR FIRST COPY, SOME FORM OF ADD FUNCTION WILL BE NEEDED)
					Remove from library
						Connect to database
						Remove book entry from database
						Disconnect from database
						"Book title, ISBN has been successfully removed from the database"
							May not be necessary as database will never grow to size that could cause issues
								Would probably only implement in webapp

Webpage set up so table contents can be viewed and edited from a different interface (computer > app)
Ensure all features work and that errors are considered and accounted for.
	Possible errors:
		Each field in book data may be null/empty
			Don't display at all/blank entry/no data could be retrieved
		Internet may be down (still on local network and can connect to database)
			Still connect to database and register all activity, just can't display book details. May not be possible depending on implementation
		Not connected to network at all
			Display error message, cannot connect to database; please try again later or similar
		No barcode found/scan canceled/wrong barcode type (not a book)
			Display relevant error message
				Return to main screen
		Book not in database
			Do you want to add this book to the database?
		All copies of scanned book in/out of library, user trying to return/borrow, respectively
			Error message, prompt to ignore

Make app pretty/user-friendly
	No blank grey square buttons
	Use settings menu?
	Save username locally instead of asking for it each time database is interacted with
	Save details of all currently borrowed books, display on main screen with option to reload
		Easy borrow -> return of book(s)
			Connect to database to retrieve list of books borrowed by saved username? (Books borrowed by this user)
			Or just store list of "<book title> (<ISBN>)" locally and update when book is borrowed or returned? (Books borrowed by this phone)
				Would be easy to implement as a clickable, scrollable list, lots of free space on main page since only other content is scan button, possibly Optimation logo (On a book?)
	Add icons to all book interaction buttons
		Coloured arrows of some kind? Book going into a return slot?

If have time at end add some sort of history list in options menu?
